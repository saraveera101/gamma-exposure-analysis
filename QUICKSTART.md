### Understanding the Charts

**Gamma Exposure Bar Chart:**
- Green bars = Positive gamma exposure (market stabilizing)
- Red bars = Negative gamma exposure (market amplifying)
- Blue dashed line = Current price
- Orange dotted line = Zero gamma level

**Key Levels:**
- **Zero Gamma Level**: Critical price where gamma exposure changes sign
- **Max Positive GEX**: Strongest support/resistance level
- **Max Negative GEX**: Potential acceleration point

### Tips

1. **Demo Mode**: If you don't have internet access or Yahoo Finance is unavailable, use "Demo Data" mode
2. **Popular Tickers**: Start with SPY, QQQ, or AAPL to see typical gamma exposure patterns
3. **Multiple Expirations**: Include 3-5 expirations for comprehensive analysis
4. **Compare Over Time**: Run analysis regularly to track how gamma levels shift

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Unable to fetch data for [ticker]"
- **Solution**: Check the "Use Demo Data" box to use sample data

**Issue**: Charts not loading
- **Solution**: Refresh the page and try again

**Issue**: Python dependencies error

### Example Analysis Workflow

1. Enter "SPY" as ticker
2. Keep default settings (5% risk-free rate, 3 expirations)
3. Check "Use Demo Data" for quick demonstration
4. Click "Analyze Gamma Exposure"
5. Review the zero gamma level - this is where the market tends to gravitate
